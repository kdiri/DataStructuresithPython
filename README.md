The example code blocks from the book [Hands-On Data Structures and Algorithms with Python - Second Edition](https://www.packtpub.com/product/hands-on-data-structures-and-algorithms-with-python-second-edition/9781788995573) that I read. 


|Method           |Description|

|a.copy()         |	Provides another copy of the a set.|
|a.difference(t)|	Provides a set of elements that are in the a set but not in t.|
|a.intersection(t)|	Provides a set of elements that are in both sets, a and t.|
|a.isdisjoint(t)|	Returns True if no element is common in both the sets, a and t.|
|a.issubset(t)|	Returns True if all of the elements of the a set are also in the t set.|
|a.issuperset(t)|	Returns True if all of the elements of the t set are also in the a set.|
|a.symmetric_difference(t)|	Returns a set of elements that are in either the a or t sets, but not in both.|
|a.union(t)|	Returns a set of elements that are in either the a or t sets.|
|s.add(item)|	Adds an item to s; nothing happens if the item is already added.|
|s.clear()|	Removes all elements from the set, s.|
