    "Sets are unordered collections of unique items. Sets are themselves mutableâ€”we can add and remove items from them; however, the items themselves must be immutable. An important distinction with sets is that they cannot contain duplicate items. Sets are typically used to perform mathematical operations such as intersection, union, difference, and complement."
